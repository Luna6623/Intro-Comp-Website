Humanities & Social Sciences Communications, 11(1), 319. Retrieved February 24, 2025, from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-02751-w">https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-02751-w</a></br>a.	Article one, titled What factors will affect the effectiveness of using ChatGPT to solve programming problems, talks about the use of artificial intelligence in problem solving. But the article also talks about the limits of the use of AI within programming problem solving. It talked about how the awareness of artificial intelligence and how the users knew how to use it effectively changed the outcome of the study. This article is mostly reliable because it is a recent publication that was found using ProQuest Research. The article also listed the citations at the bottom of the article and used proper in-text citations.</p>

Article three, titled Artificial Intelligence Is Like A Perpetual Stew, discusses the issues that learning algorithms on artificial intelligence models have in regards to copyrighted material. This article also talks about how AI models tend to learn from other AI materials. This article is reliable because it was published by a reputable source, that being the American University Law Review, and was released in 2024. This article also was found with ProQuest and was listed as a scholarly journal by their standards. Some of the faults in the reliability is the bias the author has and the potential for outside influence, this being due to the American University being a private institution instead of a public university.</p>

Article four, titled Effects of midwifery and nursing students’ readiness about medical Artificial Intelligence on Artificial Intelligence anxiety, shows how different fields feel about AI tools entering their field of study. Nursing and medical students felt positive about AI, saying that it would help relieve some of the workload. Midwifery students, however, stated that AI would likely take over their field and leave them without jobs. The article is a reliable source because it is a peer reviewed source, and it was published in 2024. One potential gap in the data is that it was collected in Türkiye, which could have different results depending on the country it is conducted in.</p>
